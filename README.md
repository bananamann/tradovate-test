# Tradovate Technical Test

I made this because Brian told me to do it. 

## Description

It's a React component for a Column Setup UI. Columns are represented by an id and a name that gets displayed. For example: {id: "startTime", name: "Start Time"}

User can drag-n-drop columns between lists and inside lists for reordering. Double click on icon of visible column should mark it and all previous columns as fixed ones. Double click on already fixed column should reset fixed status from it and all next columns.

Save button has a placeholder function (since there is no API) that just displays the current state of the data - which column ids are selected and how many of those columns are fixed.
